fping

	The fping command is a utility designed to send ICMP echo requests (ping) to multiple hosts in parallel, making it faster than the standard ping command when
	 scanning a large number of IPs.
	
	The only difference between ping and fping is the data packet. 
	
	fping Commands and Usage
		
		• fping -h → Displays the help menu.

		• fping 192.168.1.22 → Pings the specified IP address.

		• fping google.com → Pings a domain name (resolves and sends ICMP echo requests).

		• fping -4 google.com → Uses IPv4 only, forcing the ping to IPv4 addresses.

		• fping -6 google.com → Uses IPv6 only, forcing the ping to IPv6 addresses.


	Pinging Multiple IPs
		
		You can specify multiple IP addresses in a single command:

		# fping 192.168.1.21 192.168.1.22 192.168.1.23 192.168.1.24 192.168.1.25


	Pinging IPs from a File
		
		To read a list of target IP addresses from a file:

		1. Create a file with IP addresses:
			
			# vim target_IP.txt

			Add private or public IPs, one per line, then save the file.

		2. Run fping with the file:
		
			# fping -f target_IP.txt

		3. Show only live (responsive) hosts:
		
			# fping -a -f target_IP.txt

			-a (or --alive) filters and displays only the reachable targets.


	Redirecting Errors
	
		To suppress error messages and display only live hosts:

		# fping -a -f target_IP.txt 2>/dev/null

		This redirects error messages to /dev/null, keeping the output clean.

      
   Count the number of pings per target
   	
   	    # fping -c 3 google.com  ( This sends 3 pings and prints statistics.) 
   
 
   Interval Between Pings (Milliseconds)

	  # fping -p 500 -c 5 google.com  ( Sends 5 pings with a 500ms interval between them)
	

	Fast Mode (More Aggressive Probing)
	
		# fping -i 1 -t 50 -r 0 -c 5 google.com

		• -i 1 → Interval between pings is 1ms.
		
		• -t 50 → Timeout for each ping is 50ms.

		• -r 0 → No retries.

		• -c 5 → Send 5 pings.

	
	 Report Unreachable Hosts

		# fping -u -f target_IP.txt ( Shows only the targets that are unreachable. )

	  
	Adjust TTL (Time to Live)

		# fping -T 64 google.com  ( Sets TTL to 64 )

	grep alive fping_output.txt
		
		# cat fping_output.txt | grep alive
        
        or , # grep alive fping_output.txt
	
		# grep alive fping_output.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 1
		
		This command is useful for extracting only the alive IPs from an fping output.
		
	command efficiently scans a subnet, logs only reachable hosts, and suppresses error messages.
	

		# fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -a > liveip.txt 2> /dev/null
		
		
		1. fping -g 192.168.1.0/24
		
			• -g (or --generate) → Generates a list of all IPs in the given subnet (192.168.1.0/24, which includes 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254).

			• Sends ICMP echo requests to all IPs in that range.

		2. -a
			
			• Filters and shows only the hosts that are alive (responsive).

		3. > liveip.txt
			
			• Redirects the output (alive IPs) to liveip.txt.

		4. 2> /dev/null
			
			• Redirects error messages (stderr) to /dev/null (discarding them).

			•This prevents unreachable host messages from being displayed or saved.

	
	Resolves and displays hostnames instead of just showing IP addresses.
	
		# fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -n
		
		# fping -n -f ip.txt 
		        
         If the hostname resolution fails, it will still display the IP.
